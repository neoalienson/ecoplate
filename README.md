We believe that by providing communication between the consumer and the chef in the F+B industry, we can reduce food waste significantly. 

Food waste is a problem with 2 culprits: 1) The mismatch in expectation and actual portion sizes between the server and the consumer. 2) The unpredictability of food required for a particular service period and the perishability of food. 

We have designed an experience that will help consumer communicate with the servers in a simple and efficient way.
